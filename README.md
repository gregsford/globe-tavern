# globe-tavern

This is a project for my friends bar The Globe Tavern (if you're ever in Queens, NY, I highly recommend going!)

While it is a small neighborhood bar where a website for them may not be necessary, I felt it would be good practice to work on building a website for a local small business.

I am using Bootstrap to help with the styling and some JavaScript behaviors, but also adding in some of my own using CSS stylesheet and JavaScript code.
